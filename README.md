# Arduino-DDS-AD9850
Variable Frequency Oscillator (VFO) using the AD9850 Direct Digital Synthesizer by Analog Devices controlled via an Arduino Nano, shown in the attached photo.
The user is able to select the amateur radio band and frequency step with a joystick and scroll through the frequencies with a rotary encoder.  The selected frequency is shown in a 7-segment display and is generated by the AD9850 circuit board.

Selected amateur radio bands: All bands between 1.8MHz and 30MHz.
Step frequencies: 10Hz, 50Hz, 100Hz, 1kHz, 5kHz, 10kHz, 100kHz, 1MHz.

This project will be used to retrofit amateur radio transceivers, replacing their old VFO and crystal oscillators.
